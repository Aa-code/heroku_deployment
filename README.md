# General Assembly

### This is a website made for people to add and share their favorite organic products, many products contain harmful chemicals that cause dry, scalp and make hair fall out and unfortunatley become unhealthy. Since you can't always believe what you find on google, here you can share with real people and see in full detail what chemicals are in the product and what is best for you.

# This project contains  MongoDB, Javascript, HTML and CSS, Node.js Also my first time using bootstrap which was a challenge.
